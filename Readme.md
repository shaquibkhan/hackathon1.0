## > NOTES
- `Carousel` is used to show images in a sliding manner on the web page.
- It can be used in different ways
1 automatically sliding 
2 sliding with controls
3 `Crossfade` which means instead of sliding the image will have a `fade transiti0n`.
4 With Captions
5 Sliding with indicators
6 Disable touch swapping

- We can also make custom tranition on the carousel
